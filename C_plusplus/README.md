### [***Knowledge Note***]
#### [***Chapter_One***] : C++: Enhancement of C

- namespace

     - <iostream> havenot define global namespace,so we muse use **using namespace std**;

     - C++ ask us not to use head file .h. But for compatibility with C, we can still used it

     - namespace name { ... }

     - namespace could be nested

 - Practicability
 
     - We must define variable at the start of scope in C.
     
     - We can define variable at anywhere in C++
     
 - Check for variable with same name
 
     - We can re-define global variable in C. And they will linked to same memory address.
     
     - We can not re-define global variable in C++.
     
 - struct enhanced
 
     - struct is an union of variables in C.
     
     - struct is a new data type in C++.
     
 - C++: all variable and function must explicitly declare their type
 
     - in C: **int func();** means return value is int, accept any arguments.  **int func(void)**; means return value is int, accept none arguments.
     
     - in C++: **int func(); == int func(void);** means return value is int, accept none arguments.
     
 - C++: add bool
 
     - bool only have true(none 0) and false(0).
     
     - occupy 1 byte
     
 - ternary operator
 
     - C: ternary operator return variable value, it cannot be used as left value.
     
          - the left value: must have memory space.
     
     - C++: ternary operator return variable it self, it can be used at anywhere.
     
 - const enhanced
 
     - in C, even the const variable is an variable(an read only memory space).
     
     - C++, it is an real constant that fixed during compiling. (with memory space or not)
     
     - C++: const int c =5; â‰ˆ #define c 5
     
          - const is process by compiler, with type check and scope check
          
          - #define is process by preprocessor, naive replace
     
 - enum
 
     - C: enum can be initialize by any int value
     
     - C++: enum can only be initlize by the item it has list
     
 #### [***Chapter_Two***] : C++: Extension of C    
 
 - Reference
 
      - variable name is an alias of a memory space. Reference is an alias of variable name.
        ```
        Type& name = var;
        ```
        
      - Reference dose not have definition. It is an relationship declaration. So it does not allocate memory. It share the same address with variable name.
      
      - Reference must be initlize when declaration. Once declared, it could not be changed.
      
      - Reference could be nested
      
      - & is reference only when there is a data type before &. Others is get address. 
     
     - Reference as function arguments could not be initilized.
     
     - Compared to pointer,
     
          - reference is more readable and practical. C++ can avoid use of pointer by use reference.
     
          - Type& name <===> Type* const name
          
          - const pointer is the inner implementation of reference. So reference and pointer have the same size of memory. They all have own memory sapce.
          
          - Reference use **indirectly assignment**. Indirectly assignment: 
               
               - step1. Definie two variable(formal/real argument).
               
               - step2. Build relationship, formal = &real.
               
               - step3. Change *formal to change value of real.
               
               - Reference combine step2/3, C++ compiler helps us complete &real and *formal.
               
          - Reference as return value can be as left value.
          
               - Return stack(local) variable:  should not be as left value. But compiler only give you an warning when you return local variable.
                    ```
                    int& getA2()   // warning: reference to local variable 'a' return
                    {
                         int a;
                         a = 10;
                         return a;
                    }
                    int a1 = getA2();    // 10 value copy
                    int &a2 = getA2()    // 32535 stack reference, memory illegal
                    ```
               
               - Return static/global variable: can be as left/right value.
                    ```
                    int& getA2()   // no warning
                    {
                         static int a;
                         a = 10;
                         return a;
                    }
                    int a1 = getA2();    // a1 =10 value copy
                    int &a2 = getA2()    // a2 =10 local reference, memory legal
                    getA2() = 20;        // a2 =20
                    ```
          
         - Pointer Reference
         
              - 2nd level pointer

                   ```
                   void getTeacher1(Teacher **p)
                   {
                   Teacher *tmp = NULL;
                   tmp = (Teacher *)malloc(sizeof(Teacher));
                   tmp -> age = 33;
                   *p = tmp;
                   // skip some NULL check
                   }
                   ```
                    
              - pointer reference

                   ```
                   void getTeacher2(Teacher* &myp)
                   {
                   myp = (Teacher *)malloc(sizeof(Teacher));
                   myp->age = 33;
                   // skip some NULL check
                   }
                   // main
                   Teacher *pT1 = NULL;
                   getTeacher1(&pT1);       // 2nd level pointer
                   getTeacher1(pT1);        // reference
                   ```
                    
          - const reference
          
               - const object must use const reference. Or compiler error.
                    ```
                    const int a = 1;
                    
                    const int &b = a;
                    int &b = a;    // error, must use const reference
                    ```
                
               - const reference can be initialized by relative type. Biggest difference from normal reference(without const).
                    ```
                    const int &a =1;
                    
                    double x = 3.14;
                    const int &b = x;
                    ```
                    
               - Purpose of const: forbid change object by changing its reference
                    ```
                    int a = 1;
                    const int &b = a;
                    b = 12;        // error, b read only 
                    ```
               - implementation of const reference
               
                    const int &b == const int *const b;      // const int* pointer that points to const b. 
                    int &b == int *const b                   // int* pointer that points to const b. 
                    ```
                    double a = 3.14;
                    const int &b = a;   // b = 3 read only, cannot change
                    double &c = a;      // c = 3.14
                    val = 4.14          // c = 4.14, b = 3
                    ```
                    for const int&b = a, actually in C++ it is implemented by:
                    ```
                    int temp =a;
                    const int &b = temp;     // so when you change b, you change temp, no a
                    ```
                    So C++ will allocate memory for const reference, but no allocate memory for normal reference
                    ```
                    const int &m = 3;     // sucess and read only, because
                                             // int tmp = 3; const int &m = tmp
                    int &m = 3;           // error,  because  constant 3 does not have memory address
                    ```
        
  - inline function
  
     - inline in C++ is a replacement for macro in C. macro in C is processed during preprocess period, just simply replace code, so there is no check on gramma and  meaning error.
     
     - Concept
     
          - inline is real embedded in code
          ```
          inline void func(int a)
          {
               a = 20;
               cout<<a<<endl;
          }
          int main(void)
          {
               func(10);
               /*
               // the compiler will stretch the func(10) like this
               {
                    a = 20;
                    cout<<a<<endl;
               }
               */
          }
          ```
               
          - **inline** declaration and definition at the same time, same place.

          - call inline function just simply replace function like macro, without other expense(push stack, jump, return etc.). This is the only difference between inline and normal function. **More space for less time**

          - processed by compilier, so we can test error

          - no loop, no too much if, not so big(usually < 10 line), no get address operation(&),  declaration must before call.

     - inline and macro

          ```
          #define SQR(x) ((x)*(x))

          #inline int sqr(int x)
          {
               return x*x;
          }
          ```

- Default argument and placeholder argument

     - Default argument
          
          - Noramly in C, when you call a function, the value of formal argument is get from real arguments. But in C++, you can set default value for formal argument.
          ```
          void myPrint(int x = 3)
          ```
          
          - Once you give an default value, the right formal arguments should all be assignmented with default value.
          ```
          float volume(float length, float weigh = 4, float high = 5)
          // main
          float v0 = volume(10);
          float v1 = volume(10, 20);
          float v2 = volume(10, 20, 30);
          ```
     
     - Placeholder argument
     
          - type without name in formal argument
          ```
          int func(int a, int b, int)
          {
               return a+b;
          }
          // main
          func(1,2);      // error
          func(1,2,3);    // sucess
          ```
          
          - combine with default value. C++ use it for compatibility with C
          ```
          int func(int a, int b, int = 0)
          {
               return a+b;
          }
          func(1,2);      // sucess
          func(1,2,3);    // sucess
          ```
     
- Function Overload
     
     - Definition rule
          - Same function name, 
          - Same return value, 
          - Different function formal parameters(different order,type,number).
     
     - Call rule
     
          - All function with same name as candidate
          
          - Strictly match
          
          - Could implicitly cast(float->double, char->int)
          
     - Implementation of overload
          
          - name mangling(v c i f l d -> void char int float long double)
          ```
          void func(char a)                            // func_c(char a)
          void func(char a, int b, double c);          // func_cid(char a, int b, double c)
          ```
          
     - overload and default argument cannot be as the same time
     ```
     int func(int a);
     int func(int a, int b, int c =0 );      // default argument
     int func(int a, int b);                 // overload
     
     //main
     int c = func(1,2);                      // error, ambiguity
     ```
     
     - overload and function pointer
     
          ```
          int func(int a);
          int func(int a, int b);

          typedef int (*PFUNC1)(int a);  // int(*)(int a)
          typedef int (*PFUNC2)(int a);  // int (*)(int a, int b)

          // main
          PFUNC1 p1 = func();
          int c = p(1);
          PFUNC2 p2 = func();
          int c = p2(1,2);
          ```
     
          - review of function pointer (you can found detail in C review note)
          ```
          // method 1
          typedef void (FUNC)(int a, int b);      // declare a function type
          FUNC *p1 = NULL;                        // define a function pointer
          // method 2
          typedef void (*FUNC)(int a, int b);     // declare a function pointer type
          FUNC p2 = NULL;                         // define a function pointer
          // method 3
          void (*FUNC)(int a, int b);             // : define a function pointer variable
          
          ```
     
#### [***Chapter_Three***] : Class
- Concept
     - class and object
     
     - member function and member variable
     
     - Feature of object orientation: package, inheritance, polymorphism
     
     - class in C++ is an replacement of struct in C
     
 - Package and access control
 
     - struct
          
          - all action and access property is **public**, so we cannot hide inner data.
          
          - manipulation of struct is from outer function. 
          
      - access properity
      
          - **public**(default for struct): both outer and inner can access.friend can access.
          
          - **protected**: outer function cannot access, inner function can access. Derive can access.friend can access.
          
          - **private**(default for class): outer function cannot access, inner function can access. Derive cannot access.friend can access.
          
      - Object-oriented and Process-oriented
          
          - Object-oriented: Dog.Eat(shit);
          
          - Process-oriented: Eat(Dog, shit);
     
      - Definition of class
          ```
          class Circle
          {
          private:
                    double radius;
          public:
                    void Set_Radius(double r)
                    {
                         radius = r;
                    }
                    double Get_Radius()
                    {
                         return radius;
                    }
                    double Get_Area()
                    {
                         return 3.14f * radius * radius;
                    }
          };
          
          // main
          Circle A;
          A.Set_Radius( 6.24 );
          double r = A.Get_Radius();
          ```
     
#### [***Chapter_Four***] : Object construct and destruct

- Constuct function

     - Construct function is used for initilize object of class. like malloc in C.
     
     - Call:  Manually / Automatically
     
     - format: Same name with class. No return value
          ```
          class A
          {
          public:
               A( formal argument )
               {
                    ;
               }
          private:
               int a;
               int b;
          }
          ```
     - C++ has default construct function(**swallow copy**). Once you implement (deep copy) youself, default construct function won't exist.
     
     - Classification
          
          - Without argument(**default**)
          ```
          A()
          {
               ;
          }
          // main
          A a;
          ```
               
          - With arguments. Once you implement it, C++ compiler won't give you **without argument construct** will not exit.
          ```
          A( int a, int b)

          }
          // main
          A a(10,20);
          ```
          
          - Copy construct function(**default**: only copy member variable): constuct an object by an exist object. Once you implement it, C++ compiler won't give you **without argument construct** will not exit.
          ```
          A( const A &another_obj)
          {
               ;
          }
          // main
          A a1;          // Witout argument
          A a1(10,20);   // With arguments
          A a2 = a1;     // 1. copy construct
          A a2(a1);      // 2. copy construct
          void func(A p);
          func(a1);      // 3. copy constuct, p = a2
          A func1();
          A a3= func1(); // 4. copy construct
          ```
          
          - Initilize list
               
               - When a **big class** include a **small class**, we must use construct function **with arguments** & **initlize list** for big class.
               
               - When **const/reference** object as member variable, we must use construct function **with arguments** & **initlize list** for big class.  
          ```
          class AB
          {
          public:
               AB(int a, int b)
               {
                    ;
               }
          private:
               int _a;
               int _b;
          }
          
          class ABC
          {
          public:
               ABC():_ab1(1,2), _ab2(3,4), _m(100)         // random order for list
               {
                    ;
               }
          private:
               AB _ab1;
               AB _ab2;
               const int _m;
          }
          ```
               
     
- Destruct
     
     - Used for clear something before delete object. Like free in C.
     
     - - Call: Automatically
     
     - format
     ```
     class A
     {
          ~A()
          {
               ;
          }
     }
     ```
     
     
- Object new and delete

     - **new** and **delete** in C++ is a replacement for **malloc** and **free** in C.
     
     - new and delete is operator, not function. So it is very efficient.
     
     - **malloc** will not call class **construct** function, but **new** will
     
     - **free** will not call class **destruct** function, but **delete** will
     
     - **new** allocated array should not assign initlize value.
     ```
     float *p = new float (3.14);
     char *p = new char[10];
     int (*)[4] p = int[5][4];
     int **p = new int *[4];
     ```
     
     - format
          
          - new:    pointer_variable = new type (constant)
          
          - new:    pointer_variable = new type[expression]
          
          - delete: delete pointer_variable
          
          - delete: delete[] pointer_variable
     
- static member variable & member function

     - static member variable(data segment): 
     
          - Belongs to class, not just any specific object. All object will share it.
          
          - It is declared inside class, but must **initialize outside** class.
          ```
          class A
          {
               static int s;.....
          }
          int X::s = 0;            // not in main
          // main
          A a, b, c, d;
          cout<<a::s<<endl;
          ```
          
          - stored in data segment, so doesnot caculated in class size.
 
     - static member function
     
          - declaration and call
                    ```
          class A
          {
               static int func();
          }
          int A::func()
          {
               ;
          }
          // main
          A a, b, c, d;
          cout<<a.func()<<endl;
          ```
          
          - It can only access static member. 
          
          - It only belongs to class not object, so doesnot has **this pointer**.
          
          - None static member function belongs to object, it has **this pointer**.
          
 - Mechanism of property & function prosessing by compiler 
 
     - Store
          
          - member variable(use _ before its name)
          
               - static: store in object, like struct
               
               - normal: store in data segment(global)
               
          - member function: store in code segment
          
               - static: without this pointer
               
               - normal: with this pointer pointing to current object
               
      - **this** pointer
      
          - member function implicitly include this pointer that points to current obj.
          ```
          class A
          {
               void func(int a,  int b)      void func(A *const this, int a, int b)
               {                             {
                    x = a;                        this->x = a;
                    y = b;                        this->y = b;
               }                             }
          }
          ```
          
      - global function & member function
      
          - global ===> member : use this to hide left operand
          ```
          A add(A &a1, A &a2) ===> A add(A &a2)
          ```
          
          - member ===> global: add an arguments
          ```
          void func() ===> void func(A *athis)
          ```
          
          - return item / reference
          ```
          A& add(A &a2)                           // return reference
          {
               this->a = this->a + a2.getA();
               this->b = this->b + a2.getB();
               return *this;
          }
          A add(A &a2)                            // return item
          {

               return a3;
          }
          ```
     
- friend
     
     Friend is someone that need to vist class member frequently. It is not a member of class. Friend can accelerate efficiency of program, but damage the encapsulation and hiddenness of class. Friend can vist **private member** of class. Friend include **friend function** and **friend class**.
     
     - friend function
          
          - friend is none-member function that can vist private member of class. It does not belong to any class.
          
          - global function as friend function:
          ```
          class A
          {
          public:
               A(int x, int y): _x(x), _y(y)
               {
                    ;
               }
               friend int func_f(A &a, A &b);
          private:
               int _x, _y;
          }
          int func_f(A &a, A &b)
          {
               ;
          }
          // main
          A a1(1,2),a2(3,4);
          int a = func_f(a1, a2);
          ```
     
          - member function in other class as friend function in current class:
          ```
          class A;                           // Forward declarationï¼Œused for point and reference in B
          
          class B
          {
          public:
               int func_f(A &a, A &b);
          }
          
          class A
          {
          public:
               A(int x, int y): _x(x), _y(y)
               {
                    ;
               }
               friend int B::func_f(A &a, A &b);
          private:
               int _x, _y;
          }
          int B::func_f(A &a, A &b)
          {
               ;
          }
          // main
          A a1(1,2),a2(3,4);
          B b;
          int a = b.func_f(a1, a2);
          ```
     - friend class
     
          - all members function in friend class is friend function. It is used when you want one class can access another class private and protected member.
          ```
          class A
          {
          public:
               friend class B;
          private:
               int _x,_y;
               friend class C;
          }
          class B
          {
          public:
               inline int func()
               {
                    A a;
                    cout<<a._x<<endl;
               }
          }
          ```

     - friend discussion
          
          - location: declaration must in class. It doesn't matterh weather it is public/private/protucted. But normally, we declare at the beginning of class.
          
          - Friend relationship cannot be inheritted.
          
          - Friend relationship is one way.
          
          - Friend relationship is cannot be transfer. B is frient of A, C is friend of B, C might not be friend of A.
          
- operator overloading

     - Overloading means give a new meaning. Operator overloading is actually function overload
     ```
     Type operator name_operator(formal arguments)
     {
          ;
     }
     ```
     
     - Example
     ```
     class A
     {
     public:
          A(int x, int y): _x(x), _y(y){}
          friend A operator+(A &a, A &b);
          A operator+(A &b);
     private:
          int _x, _y;
     }
     A operator+(A &a, A &b)
     {
          return A(a._x+b._x, a._y+b._y);
     }
     A A::operator+(A &b)
     {
          return A(this._x+b._x, this._y+b._y);
     }
     // main
     A a1(1,2), a2(3,4);
     A a3 = a1+a2;
     A a3 = c3.operator+(c1,c2);
     ```
     
     - rule
          
          - C++ doesnot allow you to define a new operator. We can only overload existed C++ operator.
          
          - overload cannot change the number of object that processed by operator( no default arguments). 
          
          - overload cannot change the priority of operator.
          
          - overload cannot change the associative of operator.
          
          - overload must defined with class object at the same time.
          
          - most of operator for class should overload, except **=** , **&**.
          
     - friend function / member function
     
          - whose member function: who call the operator( usually left operand )
          
          - whose friend function: who is the parameter of the operator( usually right operand )
          
          - Exmaple
          ```
          class Mail;
          class Sender
          {
          public:	
               Sender(string	s):_addr(s){}
               Sender& operator<<(const Mail & mail);
          private:
               string _addr;
          };
          
          class Mail
          {
          public:
               Mail(string _t,string _c ):_title(_t),_content(_c){}
               friend Sender& Sender::operator<<(const Mail & mail);	
          private: 
               string _title;	
               string _content;	
          }; 
          
          Sender& Sender::operator<<(const Mail & mail)	
          { 
               cout<<"Address:"<<_addr<<endl;	
               cout<<"Title	:"<<mail._title<<endl;	
               cout<<"Content:"<<mail._content<<endl;	
               return *this;	
          }	
          
          in main()	
          {
               Sender sender("danbing_at@gmail.com");	
               Mail	mail("note","meeting at 3:00	pm");	
               Mail	mail2("tour","One night in beijing");	
               sender<<mail<<mail2;	
               return 0;	
          }	
          ```

- Advanced operator overloading

     - operetor=
     
          - return value should not use const
          
          - There is a default operator= which is swallow copy. Deep copy should be implemented by yourself.
          
          - Self defined problem: 1. memory leak 2.re-destruct 3. self assignment
          
          ```
          class A
          {
               A& operator=(const A&another)
               {
                    return *this;
               }
          };
          ```
          
     - operator[]
     
          - ```type class::operator[] (type)```
          
          - if x is an object of class X: ```x[y] ===> x.operator[](y)```
          ```
          class vector
          {
          public:
               vector(int n) {v = new int[n]; size = n}
               ~vector() {delete[] v; size = 0;}
               int& operator[](int i) { return v[i];}       // return reference could be as left value
          private:
               int *v; int size;
          };
          // main
          vector a(5);
          a[2] = 12;
          ```

     - operator()
     
          - **functor**: class with operator()
          ```
          class A
          {
          public:
               int operator()(int i) {return i*i;}
               double operator()(double d) {return d*d;}
          };
          // main
          A a;
          int i = a(4);
          double d = a(3.14);
          ```
          
     - && and || cannot be overloaded
     
     - -> 
     ```
     class_name& operator*(){}
     ```
     
     - *
     ```
     class_name* operator->(){}
     ```
     - Smart pointer
     
          - Typically when you use **new**, you must yous **delete** to free the memory on heap. But with auto_ptr, you don't need to use **delete**.

          - auto_ptr ( replaced by unique_ptr in C++11)
          
          - unique_ptr
          
          - shared_ptr
          
          - weak_ptr

          - private member in Base cannot be access by Derive;
          
     - Inheritance properity

          - protected inheritance: **public/protected** member in Base ==> **protected** member in Derive; private member in Base cannot be accessed by Derive;(Derive can access)

          - private inheritance: **public/protected** member in Base ==> **private** member in Derive; private member in Base cannot be accessed by Derive;(seldom use)(Only self can access)
          
     - Construct and destruct in inheritance
     
          - Compatibility
          
               - Inheritance doesnot inherit construct and destruct function.
               
               - Derive is a special Base
                    ```
                    Derive derive;
                    Base *p = &derive;
                    Base base = derive;
                    p->Same_Name_function() == p->Base_Same_Name_function() != p->Derive_Same_Name_function()
                    base.Same_Name_function() == base.Base_Same_Name_function() != base.Derive_Same_Name_function()
                    ```
                    
               - If Base and Derive has the same name function. If we donot use vitual function, Base pointer p that points to Derive object will call Base same name function.
               
          - Construct/Destruct in Derive should use construct/destruct in Base.
          ```
          Derive():Base(){}
          ~Derive():~Base(){}
          ```
          
          - When create an Derive object, 
               
               - 1 step: call Base construct; 
               
               - 2 step: construct member variable;
               
               - 3 step: call Derive construct. 
               
               - When Base construct have arguments, Derive should explicitly use **initilization list**. 
               
          - Destruct order is inverse of construct.

          - Same member variable/function name in Base and Derive:
          
               - Derive will use **::** for Base member variable.```derive.Base::same_name```
               
               - They are stored in different place.
               
     - static in Derive
     
          - static member in Base will be shared in Derive
          
          - static member must be initialize out class. ```int Base::i = 0```
          
          - access static member.
          ```
          Base::static_member;
          base_object.static_member;
          ```

- Multiple Inheritance

     - Format
     ```
     Derive::derive(formal arguments): public Base_1(arguments_1), public Base_2(arguments_2){}
     ```
     
     - virtual
     
          - Problem: Multiple inheritance lines may use **same Base**. So the **Base construct** will be called **several times** which will lead to **ambiguity**. What we need is just construct Base for one time. 
          
          - Solution: Use **virtual** when inheriting Base. Then the base is what we call **Virtual Base**.
          ```
         class B {public: int b;};
         class B1 : virtual public B {private: int b1;};
         class B2 : virtual public B {private: int b2;};
         class C: public B1, public B2 {private: float d;};
          ```
          
#### [***Chapter_Six***]:Polymorphism

- What is polymorphism
          
     - Meaning

          - Similar object(inherit from same base) act differently when get the same input by using the same name member funtion.

     - Problem

          - compiler will always call Base same name function even we re-implemment the same function in Derive. 

          - We want to call same name function based on weather a class object is Base or Derive. Base object call base function. Derive object call derive function.
          ```
          Derive derive;
          Base *p = &derive;
          Base base = derive;
          p->Same_Name_function() == p->Base_Same_Name_function() != p->Derive_Same_Name_function()
          base.Same_Name_function() == base.Base_Same_Name_function() != base.Derive_Same_Name_function()
          ```

     - Solution

          - use **virtual** before member function
          ```
          class Base
          { public: virtual int func(){;} };
          class Derive: public Base
          { public: virtual int func(){;} };
          // main
          Derive derive;
          Base *p = &derive;
          Base base = derive;
          p->func() == p->Derive::func() != p->Base::func() 
          base.func() == p.Derive::func() != p.Base::func() 
          ```
       
     - Conditions:
     
          - inherience
          
          - virtual overwrite
          
          - Base pointers point to Derive object
     
     - Binding (polymorphsim theory basic)
     
          - static binding: without virtual, bind during compilier.(example: overload function)
          
          - dynamic binding: with virtual, bing during running time (example: swith and if)
          
          - Explaination
          
               - C/C++ use static compiler, which means during compiling compiler decide object class based on the pointer points to them.
               - When the program doesnot run, program cannot know that we use Base pointer points to Derive object. So for safety, the compiler result will Base same name member function. This kind of properity will be called **static binding**.
               
               - When we use **virtual function** to implement polymorphism,  it is called **dynamic binding**. Which means binding will during running time. **vitual function** tell program to determine whether a **Base pointer** points to an **Base_object/ Derive_object**.
               
- virtual destruct

     - Construct function cannot be virtual.
     
     - Destruct function can be virtual. It leads **delete** to destruct Derive object source by Base pointer.
     ```
     class Base
     {
     public:
          Base(){ p = new char[10]; strcpy(p, 'Base');}
          vitual ~Base(){ delete[] p;}
     private:
          char *p;
     } 
     class Derive: public Base
     {
     public:
          Derive(){ p = new char[10]; strcpy(p, 'Derive');}
          ~Derive(){ delete[] p;}
     private:
          char *p;
     } 
     void howtodelete(Base *base){ delete base;}
     // main
     Derive *derive = new Derive;
     // delete derive;             // No need to use virtual ~, because use Derive object delete itself directly.
     howtodelete(derive);          // have to use virtual ~, because use Base object to delete Derive object source.
     ```

- Overeload, Overwrite, Re-definition

     - Overload(add):
          
          - same class
          
          - same function name
          
          - **different arguments**
          
          - virtual is not important
          
     - Overwrite(cover):
          
          - **different class (Base/Derive)**
          
          - same function name
          
          - same arguments
          
          - With virtual in Base is a must 
          
     - Re-definition(hidden):
     
          - Base function is hidden if:
          
               - different class (Base/Derive)

               - same function name

               - **Diferent arguments**

               - virtual is not important

          - Base function is hidden if:
          
               - different class (Base/Derive)

               - same function name

               - **Same arguments**

               - **Without virtual** in Base 


- Implementation priciple of polimophysim

     -  virtual table
          
          - C++ compilier automatically creates an **vitrual table** every class with **vitual function**. 
          
          - virtual table store all pointers points to member function.
          
          - All virtual member function(not just pointers) will be put in virtual table.
          
          - Every object will have an virtual pointer(**VPTR**) points to its virtual table
          
          - During running time, object will call virtual function based on its **vptr**.
          
          - So call virtual function is not efficiently. It is not necessary to decalare all member function to be virtual.
          
          - [VirtualFunctionsAndSharedMemory](http://wiki.c2.com/?VirtualFunctionsAndSharedMemory)

     - Call virtual member function in Construct member function 
     
          - Base construct function will call its own virtual member function.
     
          - When an object is construted, compiler will initilize VPTR.
          
          - When construction completed, VPTR will fixed.
          
          - Base object VPTR points to Base VTABLE.
          
          - Derive object VPTR points to Derive VTABLE.

- Pure virtual function & abstruct class

     - Pure virtual function:
          
          - Base class declare virtual function but not implement. Derive define its own virtual function.

          - Pure virtual function give Derive an pupblic interface.
          
          - Format
          ```
          virtual Type function_name(formal arguments) = 0;
          ```

     - Absturct class:
     
          - class will pure virtual function. It cannot be instantialize(cannot create object).
          
          - If the Derive doesnot define the virtual function. Then the virtual function will still be pure virtual function in Derive.And the Derive still be an pure virtual base.
          
      
     - C++ could use pure virtual function to implement Interface class. 
     
          - C++ dosenot have notion of Interface.
          
          - Interface class only have member function decalaration, no member variable.

- C Interface oriented program

     - Define a function type
     ```
     typedef int(FUNC)(int);
     ```
     
     - Define a function pointer type
     ```
     typedef int(*FUNC_P)(int);
     ```
     
     - Define a function pointer
     ```
     int Test(int i){ return i;}
     // FUNC_P pt = Test
     FUNC *pt = Test;              // pt is function pointer that point to function type; and intilized points to Test
     int  a =pt(1);
     
     int(*pt)(int) = &Test;         // pt is function pointer. Defined directly. Points to Test. 
                                    // Test == &Test, so you can also use Test here
     
     pt();
     (*pt)();                       // according to pointer call indirectly
     ```
     
     - call back function
     ```
     int libfun( int(*pt)(int a) );
     
     // main
     int (*pt)(int i);
     pt = test;
     libfun(pt);
     
     // definition
     int libfun( int(*pt)(int a) )
     {
          int a;
          a = 1;
          int c = Test(1);
          int d = pt(a);
     }
     ```

     - Advantages of callback funtion
     
          - Seperate function call and implementation of function
          
          - similar to C++ polymophysim, could be expand


#### [***Chapter_Seven***]:Templates
- Generic Pragamming
     
     - Same function could be used on diffrenet data type.
     
     - The C++ language base is **Templates**.
     
     - Meaning: Parametric data type.
     
          - [class is a kind of data type](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25125454/c-class-name-as-data-type) that defined by ourself. In order to seperate inner data type and self-defined data type, C++ use 2 different keywords in templates: **typename**, **class**.
          
     - Templates
     
          - function template
          
          - **class template**
          
               - [**template class**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/879535/what-is-the-difference-between-a-template-class-and-a-class-template) is an class whose origin is class template.
          
 - function Template
 
     - An generic function whose function type and data type is not specilaized.
     
     - Format
     ```
     template<typename T>
     template<class T>
     
     template<typename type_list>
     return_type function_template_name(formal parameter)
     {
          ;
     }
     ```
     
     - Conditions
     
          - same number of function formal arguments
          
          - same function body
          
          - different type of function formal arguments
     
     - Example
     ```
     template<typename T>
     void myswap(T &a, T &b)
     {
          T t = a;
          a = b'
          b = t;
     }
     // main
     int x = 1;
     int y = 2;
     myswap(x,y);
     myswap<int>(x,y);
     char a = 'a';
     char b = 'b';
     myswap(a,b);
     myswap<int>(a,b);
     ```
     
     - function template & function overload
     
          - function templates
          
               - **Does not support implicitly** data type cast. Real arguments data type must strictly match formal data type.
               
               - Use **<>** to explicitly call function template.
               
               - Use funtionc templates if function template has better match.
          
          - normal overload function 
               
               - Support **implicitly** data type cast.(char ->int)

               - Normal overload function first, when both function templates and normal overload function satisfy calling.

          - function templates overload
          ```
          
          ```
