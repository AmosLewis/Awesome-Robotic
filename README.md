Robotic Learning Note

This is a summary of my 4 years Bachelor study of  Computer Science in NJUST and 2 years Master study of Robotics at CMU.
I do this for reviewing what I have learned and filling the gap. And most importantly, helping young engineer who are interested in robotics to learn robotic technology quickly. I will start from c programming.
